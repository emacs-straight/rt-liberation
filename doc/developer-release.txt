This is an outline of how to make a release for rt-liberation via GNU
ELPA.

* compile
Check for and correct compile-time errors and warnings.


* version
In order for the ELPA system to trigger a release the version number
in the comment header of rt-liberation.el must be incremented.


* Good News
Update the NEWS file to tell all of the people the Good News.


* documentation
Update the manual, compile it, and update the copy of the info file in
the root directory so that ELPA can install it.

Compile an HTML version of the manual and update the Website:

    $ cvs commit -m "update manual" rt-liber.html

    $ cvs commit -m "update website" index.html


* tag
Tag the release with the ELPA version number, then push that tag to
the VCS:

    $ git tag -a 2.2 -m "2.2"

    $ git push --tags origin "2.2"


* push
Push these updates to the git repo.


* ELPA
Merge the changes into the local externals/rt-liberation (git will
complain) and then push the changes to externals/rt-liberation on
elpa.git with:

    $ git push

...as long as externals/rt-liberation has the right remote and merge
setup.
